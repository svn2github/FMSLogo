<listitem>
<para>
Reads a line from the read stream (initially the popup dialog) and outputs that line as a list.
The line is separated into elements as though it were typed in square brackets in an instruction.
If the read stream is a file, and the end of file is reached, READLIST outputs the empty word (not the empty list).
READLIST process's backslash, vertical bar, and tilde characters in the read stream; 
the output list will not contain these characters but they will have had their usual effect.
READLIST does not, however, treat semicolon as a comment character.</para>
