        <section>
          <title>Bitmap-Load Command</title>
          <para>This allows you to read in an image you already saved in the past.
The format of the file you save things in, is known as, a Microsoft Windows Bitmap (.BMP).
You can interchange these files with other applications such as Paint.  
Note that these files can be BIG and can take a while to read or write.
Also see the <link linkend="command-bitload">BITLOAD</link> command.</para>

          <para>See also the section on <link linkend="using-color">using color</link>.</para>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Bitmap-Save Command</title>
          <para>This allows you to save a PICTURE (bitmap image) of your work on the computer's disk so that the computer will not forget it.
It also allows you to add more work to an existing piece of work.
Remember, if your image was generated with a LOGO program you really don't need to save it as an image unless you want to use the image in another application such as Paint or as a wallpaper.
Also see the <link linkend="command-bitsave">BITSAVE</link> command.</para>

          <para>The format of the file you save things in, is known as, a Microsoft Windows Bitmap (.BMP).

          <title>Bitmap-Save As Command</title>
          <para>This is the same as Bitmap-Save Command, but prompts your for a new file name.</para>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Bitmap-Active Area Command</title>
          <para>This allows you to select the work area to be printed or saved.
The primary purpose of this option is performance and space.
You no longer need to wait for the software to build a full image.
It takes less time and less memory to print and disk space to save a partial image.
As a side effect you can adjust where your image ends up on the page by selecting different extents.
You may at anytime click on reset to put the extents back to the full image.
MSWLogo will remember what you set them to even after you exit.</para>

          <para>This command also allows you to set how many "Turtle Pixels" are mapped to an Inch on your printout.
The default is 125 Turtle Pixels per inch of paper.
Since MSWLogo's workspace defaults to 1000x1000 turtle pixels, that equates to about 8x8 inches (1000/125x1000/125).
You may increase this number to take advantage of higher resolution printers but your image will become smaller.
You can compensate for this by increasing your work space (and you're drawing size).</para>

          <para>You can also set the active area with the Logo command <link linkend="command-setactivearea">SETACTIVEAREA</link> and obtain it with the Logo command <link linkend="command-activearea">ACTIVEAREA</link>.</para>
