<h1>Lesson 3: Polygons and Parameters</h1>

<!-- title: Polygons and Parameters -->

<p>
In the first lesson, we taught the turtle how to draw a square.
We ended up with a procedure that looks like this:
</p>

<div class="code-sample">
<pre>TO SQUARE
  REPEAT 4 [ FORWARD 100 RIGHT 90 ]
END
</pre>
</div>

<p>
In this lesson, we are going to improve upon this procedure.
We are going to create a procedure that draws squares
of any size.  
And we are going to create a procedure that draws other shapes.  
</p>

<h2>Drawing Squares of Any Size</h2>

<p>
Our SQUARE procedure is pretty good, but we can make it better.
Right now, the turtle only knows how to draw squares that are 
100 pixels long on each side.
Let's teach the turtle how to draw squares of any size.
</p>

<p>
We can do this by using something called a "parameter".
A parameter is like a fill-in-the-blank for a procedure.
When you define a procedure, you leave some values blank.
When you call that procedure, you give it a value to
use in that blank.
</p>

<p>
This may sound complicated, but it's not.
In fact, you already know a procedure that takes a parameter: FORWARD.
When you give the turtle a "FORWARD" instruction, you can't
just say "FORWARD", you also have to tell him how many
screen dots to move forward. 
This number is a parameter.
</p>

<p>
We are going to make SQUARE take a parameter that
tells the turtle how long each side should be.
</p>

<div class="activity">
<p>
<b>Activity:</b>
Press the "Edall" button and change the SQUARE function 
to the following:
</p>

<p></p>

<div class="code-sample">
<pre>TO SQUARE :LENGTH
  REPEAT 4 [ FORWARD :LENGTH RIGHT 90 ]
END
</pre>
</div>

<p></p>

</div>

<p>
The ":LENGTH" is our parameter.  
When we use this SQUARE procedure, we have to put a number after it.
The number we use will be the number of pixels that the turtle moves forward
when drawing each side. 
For example, "SQUARE 10" tells the turtle to make a square 
with sides that are 10 pixels long.
</p>

<p>
We can use our more powerful SQUARE procedure to draw an interesting
design.
</p>

<p></p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <div class="code-sample">
<pre>REPEAT 10 [ SQUARE REPCOUNT * 10 ]
</pre>
      </div>
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="img/multi-square.png" alt="mutliple squares" />
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>


<h2>Drawing a Polygon with any Number of Sides</h2>

<p>
Now the turtle can draw a square of any size, but
what about other shapes.  
What about a triangle?
What about a polygon with five sides?
What about a polygon with a hundred sides?
Can we make a single procedure that draws a polygon
with any number of sides?
</p>

<p>
Let's look at some code for drawing polygons and try to find a pattern.
</p>

<p></p>

<table>

 <tr>
    <td>
      <div class="code-sample">
<pre>REPEAT 3 [ FORWARD 100 RIGHT 120 ]
</pre>
      </div>
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="img/triangle.png" alt="a triangle" />
    </td>
  </tr>

 <tr>
    <td>
      <div class="code-sample">
<pre>REPEAT 4 [ FORWARD 100 RIGHT 90 ]
</pre>
      </div>
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="img/square.png" alt="a sqaure" />
    </td>
  </tr>

 <tr>
    <td>
      <div class="code-sample">
<pre>REPEAT 5 [ FORWARD 100 RIGHT 72 ]
</pre>
      </div>
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="img/hexagon.png" alt="a hexagon" />
    </td>
  </tr>

 <tr>
    <td>
      <div class="code-sample">
<pre>REPEAT 6 [ FORWARD 100 RIGHT 60 ]
</pre>
      </div>
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="img/pentagon.png" alt="a pentagon" />
    </td>
  </tr>

</table>

<p>
Do you see a pattern?
All of these shapes were drawn by repeatedly
moving forward and turning right.
The number of times we repeat equals the number of sides.
The amount that we moved forward doesn't change.
The amount we turn seems to get smaller with more sides.
</p>

<p>
Now for the hard part: how much should we turn?
If you add up the "outside angles" of any closed polygon,
you always get 360&deg;.
In the shapes that we have drawn, all angles are the same size.
For example, in a triangle, we have three angles.
Since we have to turn a total of 360&deg; for all three angles
put together, each angle should be 360&deg; divided by 3, or 120&deg;.
</p>

<p>
So let's create a procedure that can draw all of the shapes above. 
We'll call this procedure "POLYGON".
By the way, in Logo you divide by using the "/" operator.
</p>

<p></p>

<div class="code-sample">
<pre>TO POLYGON :SIDES
  REPEAT :SIDES [ FORWARD 100 RIGHT 360 / :SIDES ]
END
</pre>
</div>

<p></p>

<table>

 <tr>
    <td>
      <div class="code-sample">
<pre>POLYGON 3
</pre>
      </div>
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="img/triangle.png" alt="a triangle" />
    </td>
  </tr>

 <tr>
    <td>
      <div class="code-sample">
<pre>POLYGON 4
</pre>
      </div>
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="img/square.png" alt="a square" />
    </td>
  </tr>

 <tr>
    <td>
      <div class="code-sample">
<pre>POLYGON 5
</pre>
      </div>
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="img/hexagon.png" alt="a hexagon" />
    </td>
  </tr>

 <tr>
    <td>
      <div class="code-sample">
<pre>POLYGON 6
</pre>
      </div>
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="img/pentagon.png" alt="a pentagon" />
    </td>
  </tr>

</table>

<p></p>

<div class="activity">
<p>
<b>Activity:</b>
Type in the POLYGON procedure and play around with it.
What happens when you give it a number less than 3?
What happens when you give it a large number, like 50?
</p>

<p>
<b>Activity:</b>
Modify the POLYGON procedure to take a :LENGTH parameter,
like we did for the SQUARE routine.
</p>

<p>
<b>Activity:</b>
Create your own procedures that take a parameter.
You can start from scratch or you can start with
one of the samples from any lesson.
