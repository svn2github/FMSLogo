<h1>Lesson 10: English Sentences</h1>

<!-- title: English Sentences -->

<p> 
In this lesson, we are going to teach the turtle to write English.
The turtle already knows how to write every letter in the alphabet,
so all we have to do is each him English.
</p>

<p> 
In the process of teaching the turtle English, we will think about
what "English" really is and how we learned it.
By the end, we will have a better understanding of the language
that we all speak.
</p>

<h2>What is Language?</h2>

<p>
You learned your first language when you were very young.
You probably started talking when you were two years old and could say
complicated sentences by the time you were four.
And yet, no one had to <em>teach</em> you how to speak, you figured 
it out just by hearing other people speak.
</p>

<p>
It's amazing when you stop to think about it.
Speaking a language is <em>very</em> complicated and yet you figured out
how to do it before could even tie your shoes or brush your teeth.
And you did this with very little effort.
There's something special about speaking a language.
</p>

<h2>Is English just a Bunch of Words?</h2>

<p>
We want to teach the turtle English.  
Before we can do this, we have to understand <em>what</em> we're teaching.
What does it mean to know English?
If you say that you "know English" what is it that you really know?
</p>

<p>
Sometimes the best way to answer a hard question like this is to 
come up with an answer and use a computer to see if that
answer is right.
You may be wrong, but you'll at least understand why you're
wrong, which gets you closer to the right answer.
</p>

<p>
We know that English has words and those words have meaning.
So maybe the answer is 
"When you know English, you know a bunch of words and their meanings".
For example, these are all English words: 
a, the, man, dog, banana, book, ate, took, kicked, and bit.
</p>

<p></p>

<div class="activity">
<p>
<b>Activity:</b>
Let's teach the turtle a bunch of words.
</p>
<p>
We won't be using the graphics window in this lesson, 
so you can make the MSWLogo screen very small and make
the commander window very large.
</p>

<p>
Teach the turtle how to TALK by entering the following program 
(below and left) into Logo.
The output from the program is on the right.
</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <div class="code-sample">
<pre>TO PICKWORD
  OUTPUT PICK [
    A THE
    MAN DOG BANANA BOOK
    ATE BIT TOOK KICKED
  ]
END

TO TALK
  PRINT (LIST PICKWORD PICKWORD PICKWORD PICKWORD PICKWORD)
END

REPEAT 10 [ TALK ]
</pre>
      </div>
    </td>
    <td>
      <div class="code-sample">
<pre>THE ATE KICKED BIT A
THE KICKED THE MAN BIT
DOG BOOK DOG BIT A
DOG TOOK MAN ATE DOG
A TOOK KICKED BANANA TOOK
DOG DOG THE KICKED ATE
BIT THE BIT DOG TOOK
DOG BANANA DOG BOOK KICKED
THE ATE ATE MAN TOOK
ATE DOG THE DOG A
</pre>
      </div>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

</div>

<p>
Whoa!  
I know English and "DOG BOOK DOG BIT A" is <em>not</em> an English sentence.
The words are right, but the order is wrong.
So knowing English means more than just knowing a bunch of words.
Knowing English also means knowing how to order those words.
</p>

<p>
I know that some words can only come after other words.
For example, "DOG", "MAN", "BANANA", and "BOOK" can only come
after "A" or "THE".
We can try grouping the words by where they're allowed to be in a sentence.
These groups are sometimes called "part of speech".
</p>

<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <th>Part of Speech</th>
    <th>Examples</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Article</td>
    <td>A THE</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Noun</td>
    <td>MAN DOG BOOK BANANA</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Verb</td>
    <td>ATE BIT TOOK KICKED</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
I also know that the following is an English sentence:
</p>

<p></p>

<div class="code-sample">THE DOG BIT THE MAN</div>

<p>
So maybe all sentences that follow this pattern are English:
</p>

<div class="code-sample">
ARTICLE NOUN VERB ARTICLE NOUN
</div>

<p></p>

<div class="activity">

<p>
<b>Activity:</b>
Teach the turtle to talk by grouping words into
parts of speech and constructing sentences 
based on those parts of speech.
</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <div class="code-sample">
<pre>TO ARTICLE
  OUTPUT PICK [ A THE ]
END

TO NOUN
  OUTPUT PICK [ MAN DOG BANANA BOOK ]
END

TO VERB
  OUTPUT PICK [ ATE BIT TOOK KICKED ]
END

TO TALK
  PRINT (LIST ARTICLE NOUN VERB ARTICLE NOUN)
END

REPEAT 10 [ TALK ]
</pre>
      </div>
    </td>
    <td>
      <div class="code-sample">
<pre>THE MAN KICKED THE BOOK
THE MAN KICKED A BANANA
A BOOK ATE THE BANANA
A BOOK KICKED THE BANANA
A MAN KICKED A DOG
A BANANA TOOK A DOG
THE BOOK KICKED THE BOOK
THE BOOK ATE A MAN
A BOOK ATE A DOG
THE DOG KICKED A DOG
</pre>
      </div>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

</div>

<p>
At first, it might seem like the following sentences isn't English.
</p>

<p></p>

<div class="code-sample">A BOOK KICKED THE BANANA</div>

<p>
Because books can't kick things--they don't have legs.
But I can imagine a cartoon where books have legs and go around kicking fruit.
If someone in this cartoon said "A BOOK KICKED THE BANANA",
I'd find the sentence perfectly acceptable.
So, I don't want to reject the sentence just because it's nonsense,
I only want to reject sentences where the order makes them wrong.
</p>

<p>
So far, so good.  
When we give the "TALK" instruction, the turtle will always say an English sentence.
Now, let's teach the turtle to say sentences about me.
My name is "DAVID" and I am a person.
People are nouns.
So maybe all we have to do is add "DAVID" to the noun list.
</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <div class="code-sample">
<pre>TO ARTICLE
  OUTPUT PICK [ A THE ]
END

TO NOUN
  OUTPUT PICK [ MAN DOG BANANA BOOK <b>DAVID</b> ]
END

TO VERB
  OUTPUT PICK [ ATE BIT TOOK KICKED ]
END

TO TALK
  PRINT (LIST ARTICLE NOUN VERB ARTICLE NOUN)
END

REPEAT 10 [ TALK ]
</pre>
      </div>
    </td>
    <td>
      <div class="code-sample">
<pre>
A DAVID TOOK THE BANANA
A DAVID BIT THE MAN
A BOOK KICKED A MAN
THE DOG KICKED THE MAN
THE DAVID KICKED A DOG
THE DOG BIT THE BANANA
A MAN TOOK THE DOG
A DOG ATE THE BANANA
A BOOK KICKED A DAVID
</pre>
      </div>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
Hmmm, "THE DAVID KICKED A DOG" isn't quite right.
It should just be "DAVID KICKED A DOG".
Maybe proper nouns should be treated differently than
regular nouns.
</p>

<p>
Instead of modelling a sentence as five slots, I'm going
to model it with "rewriting rules", shown below.
</p>

<div class="code-sample"><pre>
TALK        -> NOUN_PHRASE VERB NOUN_PHRASE
NOUN_PHRASE -> ARTICLE NOUN
NOUN_PHRASE -> PROPER_NOUN
VERB        -> ate
VERB        -> bit
VERB        -> took 
VERB        -> kicked
NOUN        -> man
NOUN        -> dog
NOUN        -> bananna
NOUN        -> book
PROPER_NOUN -> david
ARTICLE     -> a
ARTICLE     -> the
</pre></div>

<p>
Rewriting rules define a sort of game.
You start with the word "TALK".
If you have a word that is all CAPITAL LETTERS, you find a
rule with that word on the left of the arrow and replace
it with what's on the right of the arrow.
When all you have left are lower-case words, you're done.
</p>

<p>
In Logo, the these rewriting rules look like:
</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <div class="code-sample">
<pre>TO ARTICLE
  OUTPUT PICK [ A THE ]
END

TO NOUN
  OUTPUT PICK [ MAN DOG BANANNA BOOK ]
END

<b>TO NOUN_PHRASE
  OUTPUT RUN PICK [
    [ (LIST ARTICLE NOUN) ]
    [ (LIST PROPER_NOUN)  ]
  ]
END</b>

TO PROPER_NOUN
  OUTPUT PICK [ DAVID JIM ]
END

TO VERB
  OUTPUT PICK [ ATE BIT TOOK KICKED ]
END

TO TALK
  PRINT (LIST NOUN_PHRASE VERB NOUN_PHRASE)
END

REPEAT 10 [ TALK ]
</pre>
      </div>
    </td>
    <td>
      <div class="code-sample">
<pre>[JIM] KICKED [A BOOK]
[DAVID] KICKED [THE MAN]
[A BANANNA] TOOK [DAVID]
[JIM] TOOK [DAVID]
[DAVID] TOOK [JIM]
[DAVID] ATE [DAVID]
[DAVID] ATE [THE MAN]
[JIM] ATE [THE BANANNA]
[THE MAN] BIT [A BOOK]
[JIM] ATE [DAVID]
</pre>
      </div>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
The interesting part of this is the code for "NOUN_PHRASE".
Observe how it picks between two different rewriting rules.
</p>

<b>Activity:</b>
So far we have taught the turtle some English.
The turtle can say lots of sentences and everything the 
turtle says is good English.  Even so, there are still
many sentences that the turtle will never say.
</p>

<p>
Think of a type of sentence that the turtle doesn't know how 
to say and teach him to say those sentences.
If you can't think of any, here are a few ideas below.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sentences that use "describing words", 
      like "GREEN", "HAPPY", and "TALL".</li>
  <li>Sentences with "joining words", like
      "AND" or "OR".</li>
  <li>Sentences with "location words", like
      "ON", "UNDER", and "NEAR".</li>
  <li>Sentences with "action words" that only
      use one noun, like "RUN", and "SLEEP".</li>
  <li>Sentences with "action words" that use
      three nouns, like "GIVE" 
      (as in "THE MAN GAVE THE BANANA TO THE DOG").</li>
</ul>
