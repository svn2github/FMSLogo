Turtle Maze is a simple game written in Logo to encourage new Logo
users to explore the fundamentals of Turtle Graphics in a fun, 
competitive way, without the distraction of having to type.

Overview:
The turtle is set in a maze with red walls and a yellow landing pad.
The objective of the game is to move the turtle through the maze to 
the landing pad without running into any of the walls.
The game keeps track of the total number of turtle instuctions given.
The fewer instructions used to move the turtle through the maze, the 
better the score.

You can move the turtle in two ways: by pressing buttons on a GUI or 
by typing commands into the commander (the Logo way).

Motivation:
Turtle Maze was designed to keep young childen (ages 6-8) interested 
in Logo while they learn the basics.  In a sense, Turtle Graphics was 
too much learning for these childen, because many of them are too young
to spell, type, or read the error messages.  Turtle Maze lets the kids
focus on developing their spatial understanding and progress to typing
at their own speed.

Expectations:
We expect new users to move the turtle with the UI, because
it's easier.  While using the UI, the user will learn and become
comfortable with the basic ideas of movement.
The UI is deliberately limiting; you can only turn in multiples of 30
degrees and you can only move forward or backward 20 turtle steps at 
a time.  These limitations make it possible to win, but impossible to 
get a good score.  Because of this, we expect users to abandon the UI 
once they are comfortable with the concepts of turtle graphics and 
"graduate" to typing the commands directly.

It is possible (though not expected) that users will graduate beyond
typing commands and create procedures that solve the maze, and then
work to optimize the procedures to work in as few steps as possible.
