Logo UI is a simple graphical user-interface that encourage new Logo
users to explore the fundamentals of Turtle Graphics without the 
distraction of having to type.

Overview:
Instead of having to remember how to type instructions, the user is 
given a graphical user interface with buttons for some basic instructions
(FD 20, BK 20, RT 90, LT 90, etc.).  The UI also supports flood-filling
so you can create cartoon-looking color drawings.

All instructions that are run by the GUI are also written to the 
commander so that you can see the Logo program that creates the 
picture.  The instructions are also written to a DRIBBLE file named
"transcript.lgo" so that the instructions that make up the drawing 
are always saved.

Motivation:
Logo UI was designed to keep young childen (ages 6-8) interested
in Logo while they learn the basics.  In a sense, traditional Turtle
Graphics is too much learning for these childen, because many of them
are too young to spell, type, or read the error messages.  Logo UI
lets the kids develop their spatial understanding and progress to
typing the instructions at their own speed.

Expectations:
We expect new users to move the turtle with the UI, because
it's easier.  While using the UI, the user will learn and become
comfortable with the basic ideas of movement.  Having the UI and

The UI is deliberately limiting; you can only turn in multiples of 30
degrees and you can only move forward or backward 20 turtle steps at
a time.  These limitations make it possible to draw some pictures, but
impossible to draw others.  Because of this, we expect users to abandon
the UI once they are comfortable with the concepts of turtle graphics 
and "graduate" to typing the commands directly.
