This file lists the steps for setting up a build environment for FMSLogo.

Install cygwin (from http://cygnus.org/) to c:\cygwin.  Install all of the
following packages (and their dependencies):
- zip
- make
- docbook-xml45 
- docbook-utils
- libxslt
- mingw64-i686-gcc-g++
- patch

When searching for packages in Cygwin's setup tool, you might find that clicking
on "View" to get to the Full view makes it easier, because it hides the categories.

Add c:\cygwin\bin to the PATH.

Install Microsoft HTML Help Workshop to "C:\Program Files\HTML Help Workshop".
You can download this from http://microsoft.com/.
This is needed build the .CHM for the online manual (for hhc.exe).
If you do not install HTML Help Workshop to the default location, then you 
will have to modify manual\Makefile.

Install Perl.  I use the Perl from http://activestate.com but any Perl
distribution should suffice.  Add perl.exe to your PATH.  Perl is used in
various parts of the build, as well as by some of the tests.

Install the Nullsoft Scriptable Installation System (NSIS) to C:\Program Files\NSIS.
You can download this from http://sourceforge.net/projects/nsis.
This is needed to build the self-extracting installer executable.

Install the MSW version of wxWidgets 3.1.0 to e:\wxWidgets-3.1.0-src.
Build a retail version in e:\wxWidgets-3.1.0-fmslogo\retail and a debug version
in e:\wxWidgets-3.1.0-fmslogo\debug according to the instructions in
src\configure-wxwidgets.sh.  Or you can install and build wxWidgets wherever you
like, provided that you update the wx_top_srcdir and wx_top_builddir variables
in src\Makefile and screensaver\Makefile.
wxWidgets can take a long time to build, so it's worthwhile to install and build
it on an SSD if you have one.
wxWidgets is needed to build FMSLogo.

Install a Subversion client.  TortioseSVN is a good client for Microsoft Windows.

Checkout the trunk of the "logo" project from FMSLogo's subversion repository.

  svn checkout svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/fmslogo/source/logo/trunk fmslogo-trunk

Once these steps are complete, you can build the entire FMSLogo package by running
"make binaryexe" in the fmslogo-trunk directory.
