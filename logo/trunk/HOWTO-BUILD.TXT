This file lists the steps for setting up a build environment for FMSLogo.

Install cygwin 1.7 (from http://cygnus.org/) to c:\cygwin.  Install all of the
following packages (and their dependencies):
- zip
- make
- docbook-xml45 
- docbook-utils
- libxslt
- gcc-g++
- mingw-gcc-g++

Add c:\cygwin\bin to the PATH.

Delete c:\cygbin\bin\link.exe to avoid conflicts with the link.exe from
Microsoft's SDK.

Install Microsoft HTML Help Workshop to "C:\Program Files\HTML Help Workshop".
You can download this from http://microsoft.com/.
This is needed both to compile the source code (for htmlhelp.h) and to build
the .CHM for the online manual (for hhc.exe).
If you do not install HTML Help Workshop to the default location, then you 
will have to modify some Makefiles.

Install Perl.  I use the Perl from http://activestate.com but any Perl
distribution should suffice.  Add perl.exe to your PATH.  Perl is used in
various parts of the build, as well as by some of the tests.

Install the Nullsoft Scriptable Installation System (NSIS) to C:\Program Files\NSIS.
You can download this from http://sourceforge.net/projects/nsis.
This is needed to build the self-extracting installer executable.

Install the MSW version of wxWidgets 2.8.12 to e:\wxMSW-2.8.12 (or install it
wherever you like and update the paths in src\Makefile).  Build it according
to the instructions in src\configure-wxwidgets.sh.  This is needed to build FMSLogo.

Once these steps are complete, you can build the entire FMSLogo package by running
"gmake binaryexe" in the current directory.
