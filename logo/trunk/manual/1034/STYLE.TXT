This is a brief overview of the style of the Spanish FMSLogo manual.

Most of the style violations are checked by check-manual.pl, which is runnable
with "make test".  This should be run before any change to the manual is
committed.

This document describes the style guidelines that are not checked
programmatically.

1) The voice is primarily formal and authoritative (to give confidence)
   Where techinical accuracy is not compromised, it is also friendly and
   encouraging, as if talking to a friend.
   It is never condescending or insulting.
   The use of "tu" is preferred to "el programador" or "el usario".
   The use of "tu" is also an acceptable way to use the active voice.
   The manual uses a masculine "tu" form.

2) Quotations are always given according to the RAE « ».

3) The documentation is generally in the present tense, not future tense.
   For example "COMMAND hace X", not "COMMAND haria X".

4) Punctuation falls outside the quotation to clarify what's really intended
   to be quoted.  For example: SHOW 123 prints «123».

5) When giving examples, the explanation should be given outside the code
   sample, as an introductory sentence (as opposed to inside the code
   sample as a comment).
   This is violated in many places and all of them should be fixed.
   Ideally this would be enforced by check-manual.pl.

6) Because the procedure documentation is a declarative statement of truth for
   all time, use SER instead of ESTAR when referring to the state of inputs.
   For example: "Si la entrada es una palabra", not "Si la entrada está una
   palabra".

7) The following terms should always be translated in the same way

   The Commander              - El Centro de Comandos
   The (Commander) Input Box  - La Caja de Entrada (del Centro de Comandos)
   The Commander History Box  - La Caja de Historia de instrucciones
   active area                - área activa
   array                      - vector
   command                    - comando
   predicate                  - predicado
   template                   - plantilla
   item                       - elemento
   input (n)                  - entrada
   output (n)                 - devuelto
   throw an error             - lanza un error
   throws a bad input error   - lanza un error de mala entrada
   drawing surface            - área de dibujo
   turtle graphics            - gráficas tortuga
   workspace                  - área de trabajo
   a double-quote (")         - una comilla inglesa (")
