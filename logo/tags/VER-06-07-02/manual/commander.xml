   <title>Commander</title>
   <para>The commander is where you will spend most of your &PRODUCTNAME; session.
It is the means by which you instruct &PRODUCTNAME; to do what you want.
The most important control (box) within the commander is the Input Box.
It is located in the bottom left portion of the commander window.
For information on the different controls, see the specific box below.</para>


   <section id="commander-input">
      <title>Input Box</title>
      <para>The input box is tied to the <link linkend="commander-history">Output/Command-Recall List</link> and to the <link linkend="commander-execute">Execute</link> button.
You can also edit the text in the input box.
If what your typing doesn't fit, it will scroll automatically.
Once your command is in the input box you need to execute it.
You can do this by hitting <keycap>ENTER</keycap> or clicking on the execute button.
Using the Up/Down arrow keys will automatically jump to (set focus to) the output/command-recall list box.
This control also supports <link linkend="editor-context-help">Context Sensitive Help</link> and <link linkend="editor-clipboard">Editing with the Clipboard</link>.</para>
   </section>

      <title>Output/Command-Recall List Box</title>

You can select a command for re-execution by clicking on the desired line or by using the arrow keys.
If something went out of view, use the scroll bar.  
Once a line is clicked on it is automatically copied to the Input Box.  
A double-click on the mouse will automatically execute what you're pointing at.
