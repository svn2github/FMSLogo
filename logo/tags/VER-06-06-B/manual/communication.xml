<para>
If there is a variable named <link linkend="command-printdepthlimit">PRINTDEPTHLIMIT</link> with a nonnegative integer value, then complex list and array structures will be printed only to the allowed depth.
That is, members of members of...  of members will be allowed only so far. 
The elements or members omitted because they are just past the depth limit are indicated by an ellipsis for each one, so a too-deep list of two elements will print as <code>[...  ...]</code>.
</para>

<para>
If there is a variable named <link linkend="command-printwidthlimit">PRINTWIDTHLIMIT</link> with a nonnegative integer value, then only the first so many elements or members of any array or list will be printed.
A single ellipsis replaces all missing objects within the structure.
The width limit also applies to the number of characters printed in a word, except that a PRINTWIDTHLIMIT between 0 and 9 will be treated as if it were 10 when applied to words.
This limit applies not only to the top-level printed object but to any substructures within it.

<para>
All commands that start with PORT are for serial (RS-232) and parallel port communications.
All commands that start with INPORT or OUTPORT are for "hardware" port communications.
