I. Kit Description/Location (http://sourceforge.net/projects/fmslogo)

  fmslogo-6.32.0.exe   - Installer for the mainline Logo environment
  fmslogo-6.32.0.zip   - ZIP of the mainline Logo environment
  wxfmslogo-6.32.0.exe - Installer for the Beta wxWidgets-based Logo environment

II. New features/bugs fixed:

  Changed in 6.32.0
  o Implement feature #94; PPROP, GPROP, and REMPROP now run in O(log N).
  o Fix inconsistent behavior in the wxWidgets version where pressing
    the up arrow from the commander input to the history didn't clear
    the commander input.
  o Fix inconsistent behavior in the wxWidgets version of SELECTBOX
    where pressing OK when there were no choices threw a Stopping error,
    instead of outputting 1, as the OWL version does.
  o Various updates to the German manual.
