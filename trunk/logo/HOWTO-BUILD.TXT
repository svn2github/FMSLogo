This file lists the steps for setting up a build environment for FMSLogo.


Install Borland C++ Compiler 5.02 to C:\BC5 and add C:\BC5\BIN to your PATH.
Borland does not sell this compiler anymore, so you'll have to find it at
a used software store (try eBay).

Install Borland's Turbo Assembler 4.1.  Add TASM32.EXE to the PATH.
If you skip this step, you will still be able to build the debug
version of FMSLogo.

Install cygwin (from http://cygnus.org/) to c:\cygwin, including all of the 
following optional packages:
- zip
- make
- docbook-xsl
- docbook-xml412
- docbook-xml42
- libxslt

Add c:\cygwin\bin to the PATH.

Rename c:\cygwin\bin\make.exe to c:\cygwin\gmake.exe to avoid conflicts with
Borland's MAKE utility.

Install Microsoft HTML Help Workshop to "C:\Program Files\HTML Help Workshop".
You can download this from http://microsoft.com/.
This is needed both to compile the source code (for htmlhelp.h) and to build
the .CHM for the online manual (for hhc.exe).
If you do not install HTML Help Workshop to the default location, then you 
will have to modify some Makefiles.

Install Perl.  I use the Perl from http://activestate.com but any Perl
distribution should suffice.  Add perl.exe to your PATH.

Install the Nullsoft Scriptable Installation System (NSIS) to C:\Program Files\NSIS.
You can download this from http://sourceforge.net/projects/nsis.
This is needed to build the self-extracting installer executable.

Install Microsoft's Windows SDK to %PROGRAMFILES%\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0.

Once these steps are complete, you can build the entire FMSLogo package by running "gmake all" in the current directory.
