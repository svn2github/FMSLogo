I. Kit Description/Location (http://sourceforge.net/projects/fmslogo)

II. New features/bugs fixed:

  * Added for 6.25.0
    o Fix bug #2803946; SETPENCOLOR, SETSCREENCOLOR, SETFLOODCOLOR, SETPIXEL,
      SETACTIVEAREA, SETPENSIZE, TONE, and GIFSAVE no longer crash when given
      very large numbers (like 1e20) as input.
    o Fix bug #1605822; SETTURTLE now throws bad input error when given bad
      input, instead of display a dialog box and throwing a stopping error.
    o Fix bug #1602936; the sample turtle trails in the "Pen Size" dialog
      no longer have beveled corners.
    o Fix bug #1438443; the "up" radio button in the editor's find dialog
      box now works.
    o Embedded version information into fmslogo.exe for better bug reporting.
