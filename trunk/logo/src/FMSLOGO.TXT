II. New features/bugs fixed:

  * Added for 6.13.0
    o Fix bug #1661232; FMSLogo can (once again) save the workspace when
      the commander's history has keyboard focus.
    o Fix bug #1652924; FMSLogo can (once again) start up if the window
      was made very small before it was last closed.
    o Fix bug #1602862: "File - Exit" no longer quits if you press 
      "Save and Exit" then press "Cancel" when choosing a filename.
    o Fix bug #1630234: nested APPLY instructions no longer change the 
      value of ? in the outer APPLY.
    o Fix bug #1624729; the pitch, roll, and heading values now "snap to"
      values like 0, 90, 180, and 270 as easily as they did in MSWLogo.
    o Fix bug #1625096; the TORUS.LGO and SPHERE.LGO examples no longer
      prevent the other from working.
    o Fix bug #1625098; French translation tables are now properly collated.
    o Fix bug #1602864; All COPYDEF bad input errors are now recoverable.
    o Fix bug #1600159; 'CLOSE []' now throws a bad input error.
    o Implement request #1631170; COPYDEF, PROCEDUREP, MACROP, and DEFINEDP
      now load the procedure as a Logolib routine, if is not already defined.
    o Implement request #1542395; LESSEQUALP, GREATEREQUALP, and NOTEQUALP
      are all supported as primitives and <=, >=, and <> are the respective
      infix operators.
    o Improve the translation of the French FMSLogo.
    o Minor updates to the manual.
