; This is a helper program for testing the -F command-line
; parameter.  It colors the screen black and draws a frame
; around the edge.
; If the -F -W and -H parameters are given, then the picture
; and the frame should be completely visible and the frame
; should be exactly within the screen window's frame.

  ; is an error (test bug).  The correct function of this
  ; test requires that the border be drawn exactly on the
  ; window edge and no futher.

  ; Set the entire screen to black, so that
  ; any pixel outside the drawing surface is recognizable.
