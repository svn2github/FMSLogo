<para>
Logo has many facilities for controlling which instructions get executed next.
Taken together, these facilities are commonly called "flow control", because they control the "flow" of execution.
</para>

<para>
In the following descriptions, an "instruction list" input may be a list or a word.
If it's a word, it is parsed into list form before it is run.
Thus, <code><link linkend="command-run">RUN</link> <link linkend="command-readword">READWORD</link></code> or <code><link linkend="command-run">RUN</link> <link linkend="command-readlist">READLIST</link></code> will work.
The former is slightly preferable because it allows for a continued line (with <code>~</code>) that includes a comment (with <code>;</code>) on the first line.
</para>

<para>
Pay attention to the difference between an "operation" and a "command".
An operation is a procedure that outputs a value.
A command is a procedure that does NOT output a value.
Most procedures are either one or the other, but some are both.
