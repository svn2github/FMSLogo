   <title>Graphics</title>

<para>
MSWLogo provides both traditional and extended Logo turtle graphics.
Multiple turtles are supported but dynamic turtles and collision detection are not supported.
</para>

<para>
The center of the graphics surface (which may not be the center of the screen window, depending on how it is scrolled) is turtle location [0 0].
Positive X is to the right; positive Y is up.
Headings (angles) are measured in degrees clockwise from the positive Y axis.
(This differs from the common mathematical convention of measuring angles counterclockwise from the positive X axis.)
The turtle is represented as an isosceles triangle; the actual turtle position is at the midpoint of the base (the long side).

<!-- NOT IMPLEMENTED
However, the turtle is drawn one step behind its actual position, so that the display of the base of the turtle's triangle does not obscure a line drawn perpendicular to it (as would happen after drawing a square).

</para>

<para>
MSWLogo begins with a white background and black pen.
</para>

<para>
MSWLogo supports color-by-index and true color.
When using color-by-index, the index to color mapping is given in the following table.

       <title>Multiple Turtles</title>
      
<para>
MSWLogo supports up to 1024 different turtles.
Each turtle maintains its own heading (orientation in 3D), position, and pen control, but not pencolor.
Each turtle can be represented as a <link linkend="command-bitmapturtle">BITMAPTURTLE</link>.
Note that turtles start at index 0, which is the default turtle.
Because there is a limit of 1024 turtles, the highest turtle index is 1023.
All turtles between 0 and the highest turtle ever selected will be "activated", so don't choose turtle 100 and 200 if you only need 2 turtles.
Click the "Reset" button or executing <link linkend="command-clearscreen">CLEARSCREEN</link> will select turtle 0 and deactivate all other turtles.
</para>

<para>
In addition to the 1024 turtles that you can create, there are also 3 special turtles used when in <link linkend="command-perspective">PERSPECTIVE</link> mode.

        <entry>His position represents where your eye is when viewing a 3D scene (defaults to [400 400 600]).
               His orientation does not matter.
               Changing this turtle's position does not have any effect on the screen until something new is drawn.

        <entry>Her position represents where your eye is looking when viewing a 3D scene (defaults to [0 0 0]).
               Her orientation represents which direction is UP on the screen (defaults to [0 0 0], the position Y axis is UP).
               Changing this turtle's position does not have any effect on the screen until something new is drawn.

      <row>
        <entry>-3</entry>
        <entry>Its position represents where the light source is positioned (defaults to [0 0 1000]).
               Its orientation does not matter.
               This turtle only matters when you're using <link linkend="command-polystart">POLYSTART</link> and <link linkend="command-polyend">POLYEND</link>.</entry>
      </row>
    </tbody>
  </tgroup>
</informaltable>
</para>

<para>
Note that you cannot look in the same direction as UP.
For example, if turtle -2 is in her default position and orientation and you set turtle -1 to somewhere along the position Y axis, say [0 1000 0], you won't be able to see anything.
</para>

<para>
These special turtles are never shown or bitmapped.
Each time you enter <link linkend="command-perspective">PERSPECTIVE</link> mode all special turtles are reset to their default position and orientation.
