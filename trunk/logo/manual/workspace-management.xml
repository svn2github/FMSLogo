       <title>Property Lists</title>

<para>
Property lists provide a way to associate words with things.
Property lists are sometimes called "dictionaries", "associative arrays", or simply "name-value pairs".
</para>


<para>
Property lists, abbreviated "plists", are always accessed by their name--you can't get at the plist directly.
Among other things, this means you cannot pass a plist into a Logo procedure, you can only pass its name.
</para>

<para>
You can get, set, and remove properties (name-value pairs) from a plist.
If you try to get a property that doesn't exist, or you try to get a property from a plist that doesn't exist, you will get the empty list.
In general, you shouldn't care if a property list exists or not.
However, if you do care, you can use <link linkend="command-plist">PLISTS</link> to get the names of all unburied property lists.
</para>

<para>
Names of property lists are always case-insensitive.
Names of individual properties are case-sensitive or case-insensitive depending on the value of <link linkend="command-caseignorep">CASEIGNOREDP</link>, which is TRUE by default.
</para>
