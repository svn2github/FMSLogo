   <title>Special Variables</title>

<para>
Some of MSWLogo's behavior can be controlled with special variable.
The special variables follow the normal scoping rules, so a procedure can locally set one of them to limit the scope of its effect.
Initially, no variables exist except <link linkend="command-caseignoredp">CASEIGNOREDP</link>, which is TRUE and buried.
</para>

    &command-caseignoredp;
    &command-erract;
    &command-printdepthlimit;
    &command-printwidthlimit;
    &command-redefp;
    &command-startup;
    &command-machine;
