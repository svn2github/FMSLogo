    <para>When you exit the editor, Logo loads the revised definitions and modifies the workspace accordingly.
Multiple edit sessions are supported.
But be careful of having multiple edits going that include the same definition.
The last Editor Exited (and saved) is what takes precedence.
Also realize if you delete procedures, property lists, or names while in the editor they will be erased (see <link linkend="command-erase">ERASE</link>(and saving) the edit session you deleted them from.</para>

Using this feature is as if you typed in that selection into the commander.

      <title>Editor Errors</title>

      <para>If an error occurs when Logo "loads" in your edit you will be prompted to reenter the Editor.
This situation commonly occurs when a continuation "~" is missing within a list or missing a matching "]".
When the editor reloads you will be placed at the start of the definition that caused the error.
When this occurs make sure to check the commander window for a hint of what the problem was when loading.</para>

    <section id="editor-clipboard">
      <title>Editing with the Clipboard</title>
      <para>Logo's Editor and many controls support the clipboard.
The clipboard is where most Windows application store data during cut and paste operations.
This means that when you cut text from an application, such as Notepad, it can be pasted into Logo's Editor (the reverse is also true).
Even Help supports the clipboard.
This means you can copy examples in this document directly to the editor (see <link linkend="command-help">HELP</link> command).</para>

      <para>The <link linkend="commander-input">Input Box</link> also supports the clipboard.
Only one line of text is supported between the Input Box and the clipboard.
You can either use the context-sensitive popup menu or keyboard shortcuts for the desired actions (Cut <keycombo><keycap>CTRL</keycap>-<keycap>X</keycap></keycombo>, Copy <keycombo><keycap>CTRL</keycap>-<keycap>C</keycap></keycombo>, Paste <keycombo><keycap>CTRL</keycap>-<keycap>V</keycap></keycombo>).</para>
      
      <para>The <link linkend="commander-history">Output/Command-Recall</link> also supports the clipboard.
This means you can turn code you entered in the commander into procedure by copying the Commander Output to the clipboard and pasting it into the editor.
Or take text output you generated and paste it into another application.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="editor-context-help">
      <title>Context Sensitive Help</title>
      <para>Logo's <link linkend="editor">Editor</link>, <link linkend="commander-input">Input Box</link> and <link linkend="commander-history">Output/Command-Recall</link> all support context sensitive Help.
If you select a keyword (such as FORWARD) in these places (double-click works best in the editor) you can ask Logo to look up the keyword without going through the Help Menu followed by a Search and so on.
You simply ask by clicking the right button on the mouse (or by hitting the <keycap>F1</keycap> key), abbreviations are also supported.
See also <link linkend="editor-clipboard">Editing with the Clipboard</link> to bring information back from the help system (like example code) for you to work with.</para>
