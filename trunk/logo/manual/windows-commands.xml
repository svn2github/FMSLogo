   <title>Windows Commands</title>

<para>
This chapter describes how to create Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) in MSWLogo.
</para>

<para>
The term "window" is very broad and includes simple windows, push buttons, dialog boxes, list boxes, combo boxes, scroll bars, buttons, static text, group boxes, checkboxes, and radio buttons.
Using these elementary units, you can build up complex GUIs.
Each window maintains a parent-child relationship with the windows that are placed on it.
The way you program GUIs is modelled after how they are displayed, you create each individual sub-window and set up the parent-child relationships.
</para>

<para>
For each "somethingCREATE" command a parent must be specified which identifies the relationship.
When a parent of any kind is "somethingDELETEd", all its "child" Windows and controls will also be deleted.
Every Window command inputs a "name".
On the "somethingCREATE" commands it is there to label the "something" so that it can later be referenced.
On most other commands it is used as a "handle" to identify the Window or control you wish to communicate with.
And third it is also used to reference the "parent" of the Window or control that is to "own" this new "something".
</para>

<para>
When controls are in windows the coordinates used in all the Windows functions are in Windows coordinate system (NOT the turtle coordinate system).
That is the Y axis is upside down (positive numbers are down).
The origin is NOT the middle of the screen, it is the upper left hand corner of the window.
</para>

<para>
When controls are in the graphics window the coordinates will be in the turtle coordinate system.
