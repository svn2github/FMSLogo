<para>
A predicate that outputs TRUE if there are characters waiting to be read from the read stream.
If the read stream is a file, this is equivalent to <code>NOT EOFP</code>.
If the read stream is the terminal, then echoing is turned off and the terminal is set to CBREAK (character at a time instead of line at a time) mode.
It remains in this mode until some line-mode reading is requested (e.g., <link linkend="command-readlist">READLIST</link>).
The UNIX operating system forgets any pending characters when it switches modes, so the first KEYP invocation will always output FALSE.
