The manual must conform to the following requirements.

When using technical terms, use one from the glossary.
Minimize the use of multiple terms with the same meaning.
* Input (not parameter, argument, etc.)
* Output (not return value)
* Word (not string)
* Thing (not object)
* Item (for element of an array, list, or word).
* Member (for element of a list or character in a word).
* Run (not execute).
* Operation (defunct?
* Command (routine that doesn't return anything.  Should this be procedure?)
* Operation (routine with outputs).
* Instruction (routine and specified inputs).
* Logo, when refering to the general language (and other implementations).
* MSWLogo, when refering to anything that this application does.

Sample code conforms to the following style:
* Indentation is two spaces.
* Command names are given in UPPERCASE.
* Variables are given in lowercase.
* Command names are never abbrevated (FORWARD, not FD).

Text should follow these guidelines:
* The first instance (and only the first instance) of a command in a section should be enclosed in <link> tags.
* All commands in text are given in UPPERCASE and are never abbreviated.
* Text should be emphasized with the <emphasize> tag, not by using UPPERCASE.
