       <h2>Welcome to the world of FMSLogo!</h2>


       <p>FMSLogo is a free implementation of a computing environment called Logo, which is an interactive programming language that is simple, powerful, and best of all fun.
       You can download FMSLogo from the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/fmslogo">project portal on SourceForge</a>.
       </p>

       <p>There are many Logo environments to choose from, so why choose FMSLogo?</p>
       <ul>
         <li>FMSLogo has a simple GUI that encourages learning.</li>
         <li>FMSLogo provides support for exploring diverse disciplines, including mathematics, engineering, art, music, and robotics.
         <li>FMSLogo is smaller than most other Logo environments -- it still fits on a floppy disk.</li>
         <li>FMSLogo runs fine on computers that are 10 years old.</li>
         <li>FMSLogo has a strong, international user community with over a decade of classroom experience.
       </ul>

       <p>Because of this, FMSLogo is ideal for elementary school computer labs.
