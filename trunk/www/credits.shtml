    <p>
      FMSLogo was originally called MSWLogo.
      It was written by George Mills and based on UCBLogo, which is written by Brian Harvey and is still under active development.
      A large, international community adopted MSWLogo, translated it into several languages, and created countless lessons plans around it.
      Today, FMSLogo has a home on SourceForge.
      It is my hope that SourceForge will serve as a focal point for future community involvement.
