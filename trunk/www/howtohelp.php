				<h1>How You Can Help</h1>

				<p>
				There are many ways to help improve FMSLogo and they don't all require hacking on C++ code.
				</p>

				<ul>
				  <li>Of course, you can help with the programming side of things. 
					  Unfortunately, FMSLogo was written using old versions of Borland C++ and TASM, which are not available in stores anymore.
					  If you want to help on the programming side of things, you must first obtain a copy of these products.</li>

				  <li>I would like to bundle FMSLogo with lots of high-quality mini-applications written in FMSLogo that show off what it's capable of.
					  I would like them to be written in a way that people can study, learn from, and improve them.
					  Games are ideal, since my target will always be children and young adults.
					  If you have a Logo program to donate, post a link in <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/fmslogo/discussion/500407" class="blurred" onmouseover="inFocus(this)" onmouseout="outFocus(this)">the discussion forum</a>.
				  </li>

				  <li>Translate FMSLogo to a new language.
					  Each new translation of FMSLogo expands its potential audience.
					  Translators are expected to translate the text in the GUI and the names of each command.
					  Translating the manual is not necessary (but would be appreciated).
					  If you would like to translate FMSLogo to a new language, please post a comment to the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/fmslogo/discussion/500407" class="blurred" onmouseover="inFocus(this)" onmouseout="outFocus(this)">Public Forum</a> and I will send you further instructions.</li>

				  <li>If you're good with at Web development, this Web site obviously needs some help.
					  If you have some ideas on what should go here and would like to take over maintenance, let me know.</li>

				  <li>Create a new icon for FMSLogo.
					  The current icon is not recognizable and looks like a mismash of red, white, and blue.
					  The current icon has many symbolic elements, but the symbolism is not apparent to the primary audience.
					  I'd like something a little more recognizable, like a turtle whose shell has the letters "FMS", or something.
				  </li>

				  <li>I need real-world feedback on where FMSLogo should be improved. 
					  If you know where FMSLogo is lacking, please <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/fmslogo/feature-requests/" class="blurred" onmouseover="inFocus(this)" onmouseout="outFocus(this)">post a feature request</a> or 
					  post a message in <a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=500407" class="blurred" onmouseover="inFocus(this)" onmouseout="outFocus(this)">the discussion forum</a>.
					  Try to keep your suggestions based on practical experience (instead of abstract theories).
					  Also, please explain how your suggestion would improve FMSLogo as a learning tool for children.</li>

				  <li>File bugs. 
					  FMSLogo is full of them and they should all be tracked.
					  If you know of a bug, please file it in the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/fmslogo/bugs/" class="blurred" onmouseover="inFocus(this)" onmouseout="outFocus(this)">bug tracker</a>.</li>

				  <li>If you're a GNU/Linux user, you can become a <a href="http://appdb.winehq.org/" class="blurred" onmouseover="inFocus(this)" onmouseout="outFocus(this)">WINE application maintainer</a> for FMSLogo.
					  I intend to port FMSLogo to GNU/Linux some day, but that could be years form now.
					  In the meantime, it'd be nice if it ran under WINE.
				  </li>

				  <li>Evangelize FMSLogo.
					  MSWLogo is still far more popular than FMSLogo.
					  If it's because FMSLogo is deficient in some way, then let's file a bug and get it fixed.
					  If it's because people don't know about FMSLogo, then let's let them know.</li>

				  <li>Whatever else you can think of!</li>
