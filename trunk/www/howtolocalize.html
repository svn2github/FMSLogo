    <h1>HOWTO Localize FMSLogo</h1>


    <p>
      Thank you for your interest in localizing FMSLogo.
      Each new translation of FMSLogo expands its potential audience and brings Logo to more people.
    </p>

    <p>
      Localizaing FMSLogo is mostly a matter of translating lots of text in several files and then testing that your translations look right.

      Your first step is to contact me (David Costanzo) so that I can create a "localization pack" for you.
      The localization pack is a collection of files which you must localize.
      Your next step is localize each file and email them back to me when you have significant updates.
      I will integrate your changes and send you an updated FMSLogo installer.
      You then test the localized FMSLogo by looking for GUI elements where the text is either cut-off, mispelled, or still in English.
    </p>

    <p>
      We go back and forth like this until the localized FMSLogo reaches an acceptable level of quality (determined by you).
      The next time I release a new version of FMSLogo <a href="releasecycle.shtml">The FMSLogo Release Cycle</a>), it will include your changes.
    </p>

    <p>
      As I fix bugs and add features to FMSLogo, I may add new strings that need to be localized.
      These new strings will automatically be propograted to the other locales <em>in English</em>.
      You must then translate the new strings to your language.
      I haven't worked out a system for notifing people when there are new strings to be translated such that the translations can be done in time for the next release.
    </p>


    <h2>The Localization Pack</h2>

    <p>
      The localization pack contains the following files:
    </p>

    <table border="1">
        <tr>
          <th>Filename</th>
          <th>Description</th>
          <th>Instructions</th>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td><code>fmslogo-<i>X</i>.<i>X</i>.<i>X</i>+.exe</code></td>
          <td>FMSLogo's multi-language installer</td>
          <td>Install the language you're working on to see how it looks so far.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td><code>fmslogo.nsi</code></td>
          <td>The source code for the installer</td>
          <td>See the instructions at the top of the file for detailed instructions.
            Note that all languages share the same installer.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td><code>localizedstrings-<i>XX</i>.h</code></td>
          <td>A C++ header file that contains strings used for the UI.
            This also contains the canonical translations for all primitives.</td>
          <td>See the instructions at the top of the file for detailed instructions.
            Be sure to give yourself credit for your effort by changing <code>LOCALIZED_ABOUTFMS_MULTIMEDIALOGIC</code>.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td><code>startup-<i>XXXX</i>.logoscript</code></td>
          <td>A logo file that is run when Logo starts up.
            This also contains the secondary translations for all primitives (if any), as well as the translations for all library routines.</td>
          <td>This file starts out blank, so see the <a href="http://fmslogo.cvs.sourceforge.net/*checkout*/fmslogo/logo/src/startup-1036.logoscript">French version</a> for an example on how do the translations.
            Remember that you must call a library procedure before <code>COPYDEF</code>'ing it.
            You can load the procedure without running it by calling it with the wrong number of inputs.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td><code>logohelp-<i>XXXX</i>.chm</code></td>
          <td>The FMSLogo manual</td>
          <td>I have not yet written instructions on how to localize the manual.
            Instead, all translations use the same core manual, but the non-English versions list the command translations in the appendix.
            The translation tables are generated automatically from <code>localizedstrings-<i>XX</i>.h</code> and <code>startup-<i>XXXX</i>.logoscript</code>.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td><code>DEMO</code></td>
          <td>The demo program</td>
          <td>No one has translated the English strings within the DEMO program, yet.
            If you feel inclined to do so, I'll include your changes somehow.</td>
        </tr>

    </table>

    <h2>Localization Suggestions</h2>
    <p>
      To promote compatibility with other Logos, please look at how other Logo environments have been translated before translating any command names.
      The most widely translated Logo that I know of is <a href="http://xlogo.sourceforge.net/">XLogo</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      If there are two good translations for the same command, feel free to use both of them.
    </p>

    <p>
      If a primitive's name has accent marks, put the one with accent marks in <code>localizedstrings-<i>XX</i>.h</code> and use a <code>COPYDEF</code> to add a form without accent marks.
    </p>

    <p>
      All FMSLogo translations keep English as a common language and then add support for a new language.
      This way, all FMSLogo translations can run the same English programs and there's no need to translate Logolib.
      To acheive this goal, you must not use a word that happens to be the name of an English command as a translation for a different command.
      It's okay to replace some of the English abbreviations with abbreviations for your language, but please don't replace the "core" abbreviations: <code>FD</code>, <code>BK</code>, <code>RT</code>, <code>LT</code>, <code>CS</code>, <code>BF</code>, <code>PU</code>, <code>PD</code>, <code>ST</code>, <code>HT</code>, and <code>OP</code>.
    </p>


    <h2>Who's Doing What</h2>
