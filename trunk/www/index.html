    <h1>FMSLogo - An Educational Programming Environment</h1>

    <p>Welcome to the world of FMSLogo!</p>


    <p>FMSLogo is a free implementation of a computing environment called Logo, which is an interactive programming language that is simple, powerful, and best of all fun.
       You can download FMSLogo from the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/fmslogo">project portal on SourceForge</a>.
    </p>

    <p>There are many Logo environments to choose from, so why choose FMSLogo?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>FMSLogo has a simple GUI that encourages learning.</li>
      <li>FMSLogo provides support for exploring diverse disciplines, including mathematics, engineering, art, music, and robotics.
      <li>FMSLogo is smaller than most other Logo environments -- it still fits on a floppy disk.</li>
      <li>FMSLogo runs fine on computers that are 10 years old.</li>
      <li>FMSLogo has a strong, international user community with over a decade of classroom experience.
    </ul>

    <p>Because of this, FMSLogo is ideal for elementary school computer labs.
    </p>
 

    <h2>A Brief History Of Logo</h2>
    <p>
      Seymour Papert designed Logo to be powerful enough for computer research, but simple enough so that it could be enjoyed by children.
      Papert used Logo to conduct Artificial Intelligence and Robotics research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
      One of the robots that Logo controlled had a dome-shaped protective casing over its electronics that made it resemble a turtle.
      As personal computers became more affordable, the physical turtle was replaced by a virtual turtle on a computer screen.
      The virtual turtle was given a pen to help it fit into the familiar world of childhood learning.
      Drawing is already a natural part of childhood, but drawing with Logo is different than drawing with crayons.
      To draw with Logo, you must learn to think about drawing, enough so that you can teach a complete idiot (the turtle) how to draw.
    </p>

    <p>
      Logo is different from other computer languages that are taught to children, in that Logo encourages exploring ideas over getting the right answer.
      Logo should be thought of as a tool for learning, not as a stand-alone skill.
      When Logo is used best, it can break down the arbitrary barriers between subjects such as Art, Mathematics, Music, History, and Language.
      This is best achieved by allowing children to create their own open-ended projects that are personally meaningful to them.
      Indeed, the most challenging (and rewarding) task for a Logo teacher is to get the students to move beyond Turtle Graphics and use Logo to explore other domains.

    <h2>Credits</h2>

    <p>
      FMSLogo was originally called MSWLogo.
      It was written by George Mills and based on UCBLogo, which is written by Brian Harvey and is still under active development.
      A large, international community adopted MSWLogo, translated it into several different languages, and created countless lessons plans around it.
      Today, FMSLogo has a home on SourceForge.
      It is my hope that SourceForge will serve as a focal point for future community involvement.
    </p>

    <h2>Development Plan</h2>

    <p>
      There is a lot of work to do in FMSLogo.
      The code base lay in atrophy for five years before I picked it up.
      There is a lot of work to do in order to bring it up to date, without making any major updates in functionality.
      Below is a rough outline of the development steps that I intend to take.
      Of course, I will always be looking to fix bugs and make small updates that enhance the usability along the way.
    </p>


    <ol>
      <li><b>Port the documentation from RTF to DocBook.</b><br>
        This will make the manual easier to update.
        It also gives me an opportunity to carefully read the documentation, learn what FMSLogo is capable of, and fix typos.</li>

      <li><b>Write an extensive set of automated tests.</b><br>
        Without a good test suite, I cannot confidently update FMSLogo without introducing regressions.
        Because FMSLogo has a lot of features, writing a comprehensive set of tests is very time consuming.</li>

      <li><b>Port FMSLogo to gcc and wxWindows.</b><br>
        Currently FMSLogo is build with a defunct compiler and links to a proprietary window toolkit.
        Porting FMSLogo to gcc and wxWindows will open up development to more people.</li>

      <li><b>Use the GNU tools to find performance bottlenecks and fix memory leaks.</b><br>
        This purpose of this step is to gain a better understanding of where FMSLogo's problems lie.</li>

      <li><b>Update the language engine to the latest from UCBLogo.</b><br>
        FMSLogo is based on UCBLogo's language engine.
        However, while UCBLogo has made many advances, FMSLogo is still using a snapshot of UCBLogo that is at least five years old.
        There are some major benefits to updating the langauge engine.
        Just adding a "not equals" operator would make a FMSLogo a significantly better programming environment.</li>

      <li><b>Internationalize FMSLogo.</b><br>
        This will make it easier for third-parties to localize FMSLogo.
        Localization is a requirement for adoption within schools systems.</li>

      <li><b>Begin implementing new features.</b><br>
        By the time I get here, FMSLogo will be roughly the same as MSWLogo and it will be ready to be extended.
        The possibilities are limitless, but I'd like to start by adding a good sprite library, better support for 3D drawing, an interface for text to speech, a clean networking API, etc.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>How You Can Help</h2>

    <p>
      There are many ways to help improve FMSLogo and they don't all require hacking on C++ code.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Of course, you can help with the programming side of things. 
          Unfortunately, FMSLogo was written using old versions of Borland C++ and TASM, which are not available in stores anymore.
          If you want to help on the programming side of things, you must first obtain a copy of these products.</li>

      <li>I would like to bundle FMSLogo with lots of high-quality mini-applications written in FMSLogo that show off what it's capable of.
          I would like them to be written in a way that people can study, learn from, and improve.
          Games are ideal, since my target will always be children and young adults.
          If you have a Logo program to donate, post a link in <a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=500407">the discussion forum</a>.

      <li>Improve the installer so that it can be used more easily by a limited user.
          FMSLogo uses <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/nsis">NSIS</a> as its installation system.</li>

      <li>If you're good with at Web development, this Web site obviously needs some help.
          If you have some ideas on what should go here and would like to take over maintainece, let me know.</li>

      <li>I need real-world feedback on where FMSLogo should be improved. 
          If you know where FMSLogo is lacking, please <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=149686&amp;atid=775556">post a feature request</a> or 
          post a message in <a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=500407">the discussion forum</a>.
          Try to keep your suggestions based on practical experience (instead of abstract theories).
          Also, please explain how your suggestion would improve FMSLogo as a learning tool for children.</li>

      <li>File bugs. 
          FMSLogo is full of them and they should all be tracked.
          If you know of a  bug, please file it in the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=775553&amp;group_id=149686&amp;func=browse">bug tracker</a>.</li>

      <li>If you're a GNU/Linux user, you can become a <a href="http://appdb.winehq.org/">WINE application maintainer</a> for FMSLogo.
          I intend to port FMSLogo to GNU/Linux some day, but that could be years form now.
          In the meantime, it'd be nice if it ran under WINE.
      </li>

      <li>Evangelize FMSLogo.
          MSWLogo is still far more popular than FMSLogo.
          If it's because FMSLogo is deficient in some way, then let's file a bug and get it fixed.
          If it's because people don't know about FMSLogo, then let's let them know.</li>

      <li>Whatever else you can think of!</li>
    </ul>
