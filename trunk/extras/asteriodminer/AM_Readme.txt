Installing
----------
1) Copy all these files into the folder that has logo.exe in it.  (If you want to put them somewhere else, you will have to modify a shortcut appropriately.)
2) If you have logo.exe in a directory other than the default, C:\MSWLogo, change the properties of the shortcut to point at the right directory.
3) Put the appropriate shortcut wherever you want, and use it to start the game.
4) The first time you play, use the mouse or keyboard to expand the menu and read the instructions.

Where Asteroid Miner Came From
------------------------------
    In college I took a class called Computer Science in Education (or something like that).  The class was to teach Logo to teachers so they could use it in their classrooms.  I was a programmer from way back, so when it came time to create a final project, I showed off a little and wrote this.  Later, when I was, in fact, teaching a Logo class, I brought it in to show what Logo is capable of.  I also got interested in it again, so I added more levels and animation affects.
    The game is obviously nothing new, but for the curious, I ripped off the ideas from Asteroids and a Macintosh game called Crystal Quest.  It was originally going to be just an Asteroids clone, but the fastest computer on campus was a Pentium 100MHz, and it couldn't run the game smoothly with more than one object moving at a time.  Logo is a lot of things, but "fast" isn't one of them!

Technical Details
-----------------
    Since Logo is not very fast, you need about 400MHz to run the game smoothly.  (Few computers are that slow any more, but small schools are rarely at the cutting edge, so you never know.)
    The game works on a Dvorak keyboard layout as well as QWERTY.  It doesn't matter that the main keys are H, T, and N instead of J, K, and L.  (If you don't know what the Dvorak layout is, look it up on the Internet.)
    The source code isn't well remarked because I wrote it with a deadline (for a class project), and I never originally intended to release it.  If you have a burning question about something, you can email me.  When I had students of my own, I added a few commands to make it harder for them to modify the program successfully because they were fond of adding profanity and things like that.  You may notice those if you look at the code.  You will also have to bypass them if you want to modify the game yourself.
    MSWLogo provides some nonstandard commands for dealing with the timer and keyboard, so the program will not work on other platforms.  I don't plan on porting it either, but you can!

Contacting Me
-------------
    My email (in January 2004) is dan@seansastronomyshop.com.  I don't have time to do a lot of support for the program, but you can still ask questions.  If you like it, let me know.  I would also be interested in hearing about it if you manage to beat my high score of 33,595!

License
-------
    Asteroid Miner is free, and it must stay that way.  You are allowed to change it and make your own versions, but please keep my name on the title screen, and keep this file with the program if you give it away.  Maybe the new title screen could say, "Original Code by Dan Gerhards--Modified by Me."  MSWLogo seems to have a maximum filesize of 64k, so there is a limit to what you can add, but if you make some siginficant changes, please send me a copy!
