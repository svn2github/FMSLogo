This directory contains FMSLogo programs that were written by various 
people around the world and made available for others to enjoy,
study, learn from, and improve.

Some of the programs are fairly polished and some have lots of room for improvement.
If you make a significant improvement to one of the programs and would like
to share it, please email it to me at david_costanzo@yahoo.com and, if I like
the change, I will include it in a future release.
