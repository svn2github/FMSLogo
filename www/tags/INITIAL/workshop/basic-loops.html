<h1>Lesson 2: Basic Loops</h1>

<!-- title: Basic Loops -->

<p>
In the first lesson, we used a command called "REPEAT" to
draw a square one side at a time.
In this lesson, we will use more advanced features
of the REPEAT command to draw pictures that are much
more interesting.
</p>

<h2>The REPEAT Loop</h2>

<p>
In Logo, a "loop" is something that the computer does many times over.
Loops are useful when you want to draw something
that has several parts, all of which look the same.
For example, we can draw a square by "looping" the 
command "FORWARD 100 RIGHT 90" four times, as in:
</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <div class="code-sample">
<pre>REPEAT 4 [ FORWARD 100 RIGHT 90 ]
</pre>
      </div>
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="img/square.png" alt="a sqaure" />
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

 
<p>
While loops are useful when a problem has parts that look exactly the same,
the real fun starts when loops are used to draw pictures with parts 
that look similar, but are NOT exactly the same.
For example, to draw a square spiral, you can start at the center
and repeatedly draw the edges of a square, making each edge a little
longer than the previous one.
You do this in Logo with the "REPCOUNT" loop counter.
REPCOUNT is always equal to the number of times the loop has been run.
It is 1 the first time the loop is run, 2 on the second, 3 on the third, and so on.
</p>

<div class="activity">
<p>
Here is a program that uses REPCOUNT to draw a square spiral.
</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <div class="code-sample">
<pre>REPEAT 100 [ FORWARD REPCOUNT * 2 RIGHT 90 ]
</pre>
      </div>
    </td>
    <td>
      <img src="img/square-spiral.png" alt="square spiral" />
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>
<b>Activity:</b>
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Type in the square spiral program and run it.</li>
  <li>Modify the program to draw a triangle spiral.</li>
  <li>Pick some other number for the angle and see what happens.</li>
  <li>The square spiral multiplied the "FORWARD" amount by 2.
      What do you think happens if you change the "2" to a "3"?
      Try it and see if you're right.</li>
</ol>

</div>


<h2>Number Sequences</h2>

<p>
Have you ever heard NASA count backwards just before they
launch a space shuttle?  It goes something like this:
"10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, BLASTOFF".
They call this a "countdown sequence".
The thing that makes it a "sequence" is that the order of the numbers is important.
"9, 5, 1, 3, 6, 10, 8, 7, 3, 2" is NOT a countdown sequence,
even though it has all the same numbers.
</p>

<p>
The square spiral procedure multiples "REPCOUNT" by 2.
This turns the sequence &lt;1, 2, 3, 4, 5,...> into &lt;2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...>.
You can do a little math to turn the &lt;1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...> sequence into
any other sequence that you want.
For example, to get NASA's countdown sequence you could
use "11 - REPCOUNT", as in:
</p>

<div class="code-sample">
<pre>REPEAT 10 [ PRINT 11 - REPCOUNT ]
PRINT "BLASTOFF
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Can you figure out how to get the sequence of numbers from 10 to 20?
How about all odd numbers from 1 to 19?
How about multiples of 7 between 14 and 77?
</p>


<div class="activity">
<p>
<b>Activity:</b>
Experiment with REPEAT and REPCOUNT to create your own interesting pictures.
You can start with any sample program that uses REPEAT and
modify the loop to use "REPCOUNT" or you can write your own from scratch.

      <div class="code-sample">
<pre>TO SSHAPE
  REPEAT 750 [
    RIGHT 90
    REPEAT 4 [ FORWARD REPCOUNT * 3 RIGHT 72 ]
    RIGHT REPCOUNT
  ]
END

SSHAPE

<h2>Challenge Questions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>How can you create the sequence of odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, ...) with REPEAT and REPCOUNT?</li>
  <li>For some values of X (for example, 90) the code <CODE>REPEAT 100 [FD REPCOUNT RT X]</CODE> 
      draws a "stable" picture--it looks like the same shape inside itself.
      Others values (for example, 91) draw "twisty" pictures.
      What makes a value stable?  
      What makes it twisty?
      Is there a limit to the number of stable pictures can you draw with this pattern?</li>
  <li>Why is it that, when you repeat the SQUIRAL program, it ends up going around in a circle,
      but when you repeat the STARSPIRAL program, it goes off in a straight line?</li>
  <li>Why does the SSHAPE command curve inward than outward (and back again), instead of either
      spiraling inward forever or spiraling outward forever?</li>
</ul>
