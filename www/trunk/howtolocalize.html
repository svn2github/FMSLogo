    <h1>HOWTO Localize FMSLogo</h1>


    <p>
      Thank you for your interest in localizing FMSLogo.
      Each new translation of FMSLogo expands its potential audience and brings Logo to more people.
    </p>

    <p>
      Localizaing FMSLogo is mostly a matter of translating lots of text in several files and then testing that your translations look right.

      Your first step is to contact me (David Costanzo) so that I can create a "localization pack" for you.
      The localization pack is a collection of files which you must localize.
      Your next step is localize each file and email them back to me when you have significant updates.
      I will integrate your changes and send you an updated FMSLogo installer.
      You then test the localized FMSLogo by looking for GUI elements where the text is either cut-off, mispelled, or still in English.
    </p>

    <p>
      We go back and forth like this until the localized FMSLogo reaches an acceptable level of quality (determined by you).
      The next time I release a new version of FMSLogo (see <a href="releasecycle.shtml">the FMSLogo Release Cycle</a>), it will include your changes.
    </p>

    <p>
      As I fix bugs and add features to FMSLogo, I may add new strings that need to be localized.
      These new strings will automatically be propograted to the other locales <em>in English</em>.
      You must then translate the new strings to your language.
      I haven't worked out a system for notifing people when there are new strings to be translated such that the translations can be done in time for the next release.
    </p>


    <h2>The Localization Pack</h2>

    <p>
      The localization pack contains the following files:
    </p>

    <table border="1">
        <tr>
          <th>Filename</th>
          <th>Description</th>
          <th>Instructions</th>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td><code>fmslogo-<i>X</i>.<i>X</i>.<i>X</i>+.exe</code></td>
          <td>FMSLogo's multi-language installer</td>
          <td>Install the language you're working on to see how it looks so far.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td><code>fmslogo.nsi</code></td>
          <td>The source code for the installer</td>
          <td>See the instructions at the top of the file for detailed instructions.
            Note that all languages share the same installer.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td><code>localizedstrings-<i>XX</i>.h</code></td>
          <td>A C++ header file that contains strings used for the UI.
            This also contains the canonical translations for all primitives.</td>
          <td>See the instructions at the top of the file for detailed instructions.
            Be sure to give yourself credit for your effort by changing <code>LOCALIZED_ABOUTFMS_MULTIMEDIALOGIC</code>.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td><code>startup-<i>XXXX</i>.logoscript</code></td>
          <td>A logo file that is run when Logo starts up.
            This also contains the secondary translations for all primitives (if any), as well as the translations for all library routines.</td>
          <td>This file starts out blank, so see the <a href="http://fmslogo.cvs.sourceforge.net/*checkout*/fmslogo/logo/src/startup-1036.logoscript">French version</a> for an example on how do the translations.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td><code>logohelp-<i>XXXX</i>.chm</code></td>
          <td>The FMSLogo manual</td>
          <td>I have not yet written instructions on how to localize the manual.
            Instead, all translations either supply their own manual, or use the English versions and list the command translations in the appendix.
            The translation tables are generated automatically from <code>localizedstrings-<i>XX</i>.h</code> and <code>startup-<i>XXXX</i>.logoscript</code>.</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td><code>DEMO</code></td>
          <td>The demo program</td>
          <td>All of the strings for all languages are included in the same DEMO program.
            The program uses LOGOVERSION to determine which strings to show.</td>
        </tr>

    </table>

    <h2>Localization Suggestions</h2>
    <p>
      To promote compatibility with other Logos, please look at how other Logo environments have been translated before translating any command names.
      The most widely translated Logo that I know of is <a href="http://xlogo.sourceforge.net/">XLogo</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      If there are two good translations for the same command, feel free to use both of them.
    </p>

    <p>
      If a primitive's name has accent marks, put the one with accent marks in <code>localizedstrings-<i>XX</i>.h</code> and use a <code>COPYDEF</code> to add a form without accent marks.
    </p>

    <p>
      All FMSLogo translations keep English as a common language and then add support for a new language.
      This way, all FMSLogo translations can run the same English programs and there's no need to translate Logolib.
      To acheive this goal, you must not use a word that happens to be the name of an English command as a translation for a different command.
      It's okay to replace some of the English abbreviations with abbreviations for your language, but please don't replace the "core" abbreviations: <code>FD</code>, <code>BK</code>, <code>RT</code>, <code>LT</code>, <code>BF</code>, <code>PU</code>, <code>PD</code>, <code>ST</code>, <code>HT</code>, <code>SE</code>, and <code>OP</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Do not translate any of the deprecated commands.
      They are only supported in the English version for backward-compatibility of old English programs, so they are unnecessary in the translated vesions.
    </p>


    <h2>Who's Doing What</h2>
